# Natural Skincare Basics

## First and foremost...
> Every person needs their own individual skincare routine. No two people have the same skin, so bear in mind what your skin is like. My formulations are based on my own experiences but can be adjusted to suit any skin type.

## Ingredients
There are several types of ingredients that allow you to make many skincare products:
- **Waxes**
- **Nourishing oil(s)**
- **Butters**
- **Carrier oil(s)**

### A Quick Guide to Skincare Oils
category|purpose|oils|traits
---|---|---|---|
carrier|basic workhorse oils for most any application| olive, almond, coconut, hemp (see note)
utility| primarily cleansing | castor, coconut
nourishment|specific skincare benefits | vitamin e, jojoba, argan

*A note on hemp*: Hempseed oil has a distinct odor that is even stronger than that of olive oil, so keep that in mind if using it as a carrier. You'll likely want to dilute it with almond, coconut, or some other oil with a lighter scent. It also should be refrigerated, which will negatively impact the shelf life of your finished products.

### Essentials
Here are my skincare essentials and how I use them.
- organic beeswax pastilles for salves, balms, and lotions
- raw organic shea butter for salves, balms, and lotions
- organic coconut oil for salves, balms, lotions, and carrier use
- 10 or 15,000 IU vitamin E oil (usually it's in a sunflower oil base) for everything **Vitamin E has preservative properties so it's not a bad idea to add it to everything to lengthen shelf life a bit, plus great for skin!**
- organic jojoba oil for extra nourishment in everything
- organic almond oil for an all purpose carrier
- organic ACV (apple cider vinegar)
- organic aloe juice
- organic castor oil for oil cleanse
- rose water for nourishing base, general spritzing, body wash, etc.
- various herbs for infusing into skincare oils

A note on shelf life:
> I advise against making any formulation in a large amount for personal use, since these products don't contain much in the way of preservatives. That being said, all of their shelf lives will benefit from added vitamin E and your skin will like it too!

## My Routine
purpose|ingredients/tools|timing|notes|
---|---|---|---|
everyday cleansing|water, microfiber face cloth|as needed|try to do this no more than 2x/day to avoid unnecessarily stripping out oils and making your skin sad
gentler cleansing| nourishing blend + castor oil|as needed|doesn't leave skin dry
toner|50% diluted ACV|after cleansing and before moisturizing 1x/day
moisturizing (*nourishing base*)|dime-sized amount nourishing blend + 2 drops aloe + spritz rose water (optional)|post-cleansing | moisturize that beautiful face EVERY time you cleanse it
makeup removal|coconut oil, microfiber cloth, aloe|as needed|use coconut oil directly on skin to aid in removal of eyeliner, lipstick, etc. wipe off with microfiber cloth or cotton round wet with some aloe and few drops of *custom* nourishing blend to reduce friction and soothe tender skin
lip recovery|vitamin E oil, aloe|as needed after lip makeup removal|smoothe a thin layer of aloe on clean lips, wait a few moments, then smoothe a thin layer of vitamin E oil onto lips
