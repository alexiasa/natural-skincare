# Natural Skincare üå±
Here is some of the natural skincare knowledge that I have learned and recipes I have improved upon over time. I think it's pretty much everything you need to know to start your own natural skincare routine. The recipes will continue to evolve over time as I keep learning and improving upon these unique formulations. This is the first time I'd sat down to collect some of this knowledge into a format I could share.

When I started out, my goal was to start a beauty regimen that I could eat. My goal was to put as much food on my face as I could. Why? 1) When I started this natural skincare journey, I was on SNAP. Being able to buy nearly all of the (mostly organic) ingredients for my skincare products on food stamps was empowering. It was also probably the only way I was able to make it happen! 2) If I could feel good about eating it, then it‚Äôs probably not horrible for my skin. I wear makeup and there is already the general wear and tear of the day on my face, so it feels nice to start and end each day as naturally as I possibly can.
