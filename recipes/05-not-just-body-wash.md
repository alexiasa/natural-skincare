# Body wash

With a few tweaks to your liking, this can be a body wash, shampoo, or beard wash tailored to your needs. I've also used this basic recipe as a starting point for a ph-balanced body wash.

## Basic recipe
- 1 part water
- 1 part liquid castile soap
- essential oils to your preference

The goal for this recipe is to have approximately half castile soap and half "other stuff". You can get creative with the other stuff.

## Customization Notes
- Substitute up to half of the water/rose water with organic aloe
- Substitute no more than a quarter of the water/rose water with nourishing blend. You may need to adjust this up or down to get the right amount of suds. *Less oil = more suds*

I usually make this in a small quantity (like airplane carry on size) because I'm always changing up the formula. I alternate between making one that's a more skin-moisturizing formula (with added nourishing blend) and one that I can also use as a shampoo.
