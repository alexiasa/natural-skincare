# Body wash

Ok, this is "bonus content" since it's not strictly face-related, but I wanted to share this recipe because it's super versatile and customizable.

With a few tweaks to your liking, this can be a body wash, shampoo, or beard wash tailored to your needs.

## Basic recipe
- 1 part water or rose water\*
- 1 part liquid castile soap
- essential oils to your preference

The goal for this recipe is to have approximately half castile soap and half "other stuff". You can get creative with the other stuff.

## Other Stuff Options
- Substitute up to half of the water/rose water with organic aloe
- Substitute no more than a quarter of the water/rose water with nourishing blend. You may need to adjust this up or down to get the right amount of suds. *Less oil = more suds*

I usually make this in a small quantity (like airplane carry on size) because I'm always experimenting with the formula. I alternate between making one that's a more skin-moisturizing formula and one that I can also use as a shampoo.
