## Notes on Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice (for your face)
I generically refer to it as a sugar scrub but really there's a variety of food items that can be used to give your face a thorough yet gentle exfoliation! I have used sugar, ground coffee beans, salt, and a few blends of those with varying degrees of success.

My feedback on abrasive things is that I tend to stick with sugar or brown sugar. I personally didn't enjoy using coffee by itself but along with brown sugar, it's divine!
