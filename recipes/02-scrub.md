# Scrub
I almost generically referred to it a sugar scrub but really there's a variety of abrasive food items that can be used to give your face a thorough yet gentle exfoliation! I have used sugar, ground coffee beans, salt, and a few blends of those with varying degrees of success.

## Basic recipe
- 1 part nourishing blend (optional: add extra vitamin E oil)
- 2 parts sugar
- essential oils

Scrub this stuff on your face and scrub away the day. Or, scrub yourself awake. This is your skincare routine. You do you.

My feedback on abrasive things is that I ususally stick with sugar or brown sugar. I personally didn't enjoy using coffee by itself but along with brown sugar it's divine!
