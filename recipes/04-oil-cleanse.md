# Oil cleanse

Start with about 50/50 nourishing blend and castor oil. You will need no more than a few drops of each for one cleanse.

- Mix the two oils together well
- Massage the oils into your face slowly using a firm, circular motion with your hands. Try to spend a whole minute on this. Really think about how you are using the oils to gently scrub the day's nonsense (or future nonsense?) right off your face.
- Grab a washcloth and run it under very hot water.
- Place the hot washcloth on your face until it cools. Repeat 2 more times.

The aftermath of this gentle cleanse should be a slightly moisturized, clean face. Afterwards, you may still wish to moisturize with the nourishing base. It does not mean you did the oil cleanse wrong! The oil cleanse is a *cleanse* so it shouldn't leave your face feeling fully moisturized even though it uses oils.  

*Note*: not for makeup removal.
