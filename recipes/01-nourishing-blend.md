# Nourishing blend

## Basic recipe
5 parts - almond and/or other carrier oils
3 parts - coconut oil
2 parts - nourishing oils (I tend to use more jojoba/etc. & less vitamin E, which can be quite viscous)

> For this one, the coconut oil can be tricky. Use too much and the mixture wants to solidify when cold! If your coconut oil is solid, melt it before blending.

> My experience is that coconut oil tends to be more drying than other carrier oils, so this is how I would recommend starting to figure out the right balance for your skin:

⬆️ If it feels like it's **not moisturizing enough**, try adding a bit more vitamin E. You can also substitute some of the carrier oil for the coconut oil to suit your needs.

⬇️ If it feels like it's **too heavy**, try reducing the vitamin E. You can also substitute some of the coconut oil for the carrier oil to suit your needs.

I store this blend in an amber glass bottle with push spout top.
