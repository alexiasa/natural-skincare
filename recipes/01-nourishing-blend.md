# Nourishing Blend
## Combination Skin
- 5 parts - almond oil and/or other carrier oils
- 3 parts - coconut oil
- 2 parts - nourishing oils (see notes)

Shake before use!

I usually store this blend in a 2 oz amber glass bottle with treatment pump top. A dropper would work too. I shake it before use each time. In the winter, it gets cloudy due to the coconut oil, but not entirely solid.

## Oily Skin
- 4 parts - carrier oils
- 4 parts - coconut oil
- 1 part nourishing oils (see notes)
- 1 part vitamin E oil

You will want to store this formulation in a jar as it is likely to solidify due to the coconut oil.

## Dry Skin
- 6 parts carrier oils
- 2 parts coconut oil
- 2 parts nourishing oils (see notes)

Shake before use!

This blend can be stored in an amber glass bottle with treatment pump top. A dropper would work too.

## Customization Notes
### Nourishing Oils
Think about what your skin needs. You may have to tinker with your recipe to get the right results.
- I use the combination skin version myself and I tend to include a bit more jojoba/etc. & a bit less vitamin E, *depending how viscous the vitamin E oil is*. I suggest starting with 60% jojoba and 40% vitamin E oil.
- For the dry skin version, I recommend starting with 60% vitamin E oil and 40% jojoba/etc.
- For the oily skin version, I recommend starting with 50% jojoba/etc. and 50% vitamin E oil.

### Coconut Oil & Recipe Fine Tuning
My experience is that coconut oil tends to be more drying than other carrier oils, so this is how I would recommend starting to figure out the right balance for your skin:

- ⬆️ If it feels like it's **not moisturizing enough**, try adding a bit more vitamin E. You can also substitute some of the carrier oil for the coconut oil until you find a consistency that works for you.

- ⬇️ If it feels like it's **too heavy**, try reducing the vitamin E. You can also substitute some of the coconut oil for the carrier oil until you find a consistency that works for you.
