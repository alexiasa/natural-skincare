Infused oil?

> This infused oil blend was designed for use in a specific medicated salve, but these ingredients are good for fighting acne, yeast, and other nasties as well as soothing the skin. Originally I infused 8 oz coconut oil, 1 tbsp vitamin e oil, and 4 tbsp jojoba oil with the following:
- 1.5 oz goldenseal
- 1.5 oz Oregon grape
- 1 oz echinacea
- 0.5 oz calendula

don't know how to infuse oils? here's a super quick primer:
- place oil and herbs into a glass jar with lid
- place jar into a water bath on the stove or in a crock pot (works really well!)
- heat oil and herbs on low heat to about 185-200 degrees Fahrenheit and keep it there for 4-6 hours
- check temp every half hour or so; don't let it go over 205 degrees
- strain herbs out of oil using cheesecloth or a mesh strainer
