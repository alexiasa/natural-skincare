# Clay & charcoal mask

## Basic recipe
- 3 parts bentonite clay
- 1 part activated charcoal
- enough apple cider vinegar to form a paste
- *optional*: few drops aloe, few drops vitamin E oil, a drop of desired essential oil

Full strength or 50/50 diluted ACV works but you may want to opt for full strength if adding optional ingredients.

Typically I need no more than 1-2 tablespoons of bentonite clay and charcoal mixture to do a single mask.

Mix these in a non-metal container using non-metal utensils. Stir in optional ingredients and apple cider vinegar just enough to make a thick paste. If you miss that sweet spot and it gets too wet/dry, add a bit more clay/ACV and try again until you get it right!

Slather it on your clean face and leave for about 10 minutes before wiping off. The charcoal may be kinda dirty but your face will get a nice deep clean!\*

\* you can also do this with just bentonite clay or a different clay if you prefer
